## What is This?
This project is a UWP-based utility for Dungeons & Dragons to help players manage their character(s), have easy access to handbook content, and give Dungeon Masters a utility through which they can manage their campaigns.
### Why Create It?
While being a novice D&D player and playing the game with my group, we came to the realization that having to manage characters using either pen/pencil and paper or editable PDF's, while simple initially, can become rather tedious. Hence my resolve to make the free utility for players both new and experienced that is easily accessible.
## What Can It Do?
The app itself is broken down into 3 primary sections: **Character Management**, a **Player Codex** for key aspects of D&D, and a **DM Console**.
### Character Management:
- General Character Properties:
  + View Health, Race, Class, Background, etc
  + Manage player notes
  + Keep track of death save successes and failures
  + Dice rolling module (optional to real dice of course)
  + General information module to summarize the overall significance of all stats and what they mean for your character

- Character Biography:
  + Flaws
  + Motivations
  + etc

- Skill Levels & Specializations:
  + Keep track of which stat-specific perks your character has
  + Indicates respective skill modifier based on base skill level

- Spell Management:

  + Manage cantrips
