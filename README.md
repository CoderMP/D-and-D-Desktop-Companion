# **D&D Desktop Companion**

## **Why Create This Mobile Utility?**
While being a novice D&D player and playing the game with my group, we came to the realization that having to manage characters using either pen/pencil and paper or editable PDF's, while simple initially, can become rather tedious. Hence my resolve to make the free utility for players both new and experienced that is easily accessible. This app (and its smaller Android brother of the same name) act as a Character Manager, Encyclopedia, and DM Tool.

## **What Can It Do?**
The app itself is broken down into 3 primary sections: Character Management, a small Codex for key aspects of D&D, and a DM Console.  

On the side of **Character Management** you can live-edit different character-related categories, such as:
  * General Character Properties (e.g. Health, Race, Class, Background, etc)
  * Character Biography, motivations, flaws, etc
  * Skill levels and Specializations
  * Inventory/Item management

On the side of the **Player Codex**, you can make quick lookup of topics on:
* The different Races within D&D
  * Player Races
  * Enemy Races
* Player Classes
* Player Backgrounds
* Spells
* Gear
  * Armour
  * Weapons
  * Items/Consumables
* Languages within D&D

Finally, on the side of the **DM Console**, you can view:
* Story Campaigns
* Creature Manual
* Weapons, Items, and Consumables
* Story Progression Tips
